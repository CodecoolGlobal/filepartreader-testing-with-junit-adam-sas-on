A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

STAR WARS: EPISODE II; "ATTACK OF THE CLONES"
By: GEORGE LUCAS & JONATHAN HALES

There is  unrest  in the Galactic
Senate.  Several  thousand  solar
systems   have   declared   their
intentions to leave the Republic.

The      separatist     movement,
under   the   leadership  of  the
mysterious   Count   Dooku,   has
made it difficult for the limited
number   of   Jedi   Knights   to
maintain  peace and order  in the
galaxy.

Senator    Amidala,   the  former
Queen   of  Naboo,  is  returning
to  the  Galactic Senate  to vote
on the critical issue of creating
an   ARMY    OF    THE   REPUBLIC
to    assist    the   overwhelmed
Jedi....


LIEUTENANT: Senator, we're making our final approach in to Coruscant.

SENATOR AMIDALA: Very good, Lieutenant.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all.

PADMÉ: Cordé...

CORDÉ: M'Lady ...I'm so sorry, M'Lady... I've failed you, Senator.

AMIDALA: No...!

CAPTAIN TYPHO: M'Lady, you are still in danger here.

AMIDALA: I shouldn't have come back.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: This vote is very important. You did your duty - Cordé did hers. Now come. Senator Amidala, please!

PALPATINE: I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatist.

MACE WINDU: If they do break away -

PALPATINE: I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two. My negotiations will not fail!

MACE WINDU: If they do, you must realize there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

PALPATINE: Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war?

YODA: The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.

DAR WAC: (in Huttese) The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord.

PALPATINE: Good. Send them in. We will discuss this matter later.

YODA: Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform -- terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.

PADMÉ: Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?

MACE WINDU: Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.

PADMÉ: I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

KI-ADI-MUNDI: He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

MACE WINDU: You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn't assassinate anyone. It's not in his character.

YODA: But for certain, Senator... in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE: Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces?

BAIL ORGANA: Do you think that is a wise decision during these stressful times?

PADMÉ: Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe...

PALPATINE: ... The situation is that serious. No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi.

MACE WINDU: That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.

PALPATINE: Do it for me, milady. Please? The thought of losing you... is unbearable.

MACE WINDU: I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.

PADMÉ: Thank you, Master Windu.

OBI-WAN: You seem a little on edge.

ANAKIN: Not at all.

OBI-WAN: I haven't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks.

ANAKIN: You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you, remember?

OBI-WAN: Oh yeah... You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.

ANAKIN: I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

JAR JAR: Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to seein yousa.

OBI-WAN: It's good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR: Senator Padmé. Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven.

OBI-WAN: It's a pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.

PADMÉ: It has been far too long Master Kenobi.
Ani? My goodness, you've grown.

ANAKIN: So have you. Grown more beautiful, I mean. Well, for senator, I mean.

PADMÉ: Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

OBI-WAN: Our presence here will be invisible, M'Lady, I can assure you.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service. Queen Jamillia has informed of your assignment. I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.

PADMÉ: I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.

OBI-WAN: We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation.

ANAKIN: We will find out who's trying to kill you Padmé, I promise you.

OBI-WAN: We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner!

ANAKIN: I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.

OBI-WAN: We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin. And you will pay attention to my lead.

ANAKIN: Why?

OBI-WAN: What??!!

ANAKIN: Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.

OBI-WAN: We will do exactly as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.

PADMÉ: Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire.

TYPHO: Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. I'll have an officer stationed on every floor and I'll be in the control center downstairs.

JAR JAR: Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Annie.

ANAKIN: She hardly even recognized me, Jar Jar. I've thought about her every day since we parted and... she's forgotten me completely.

JAR JAR: Shesa happy. Happier den mesa seein her in longo time.

OBI-WAN: You're focusing on the negative again, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now lets check the security.

ZAM WESELL: I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

JANGO FETT: We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Take these. Be careful. They're very poisonous. And, Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.

OBI-WAN: Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin would try that way. Any activity up here?

ANAKIN: Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.

OBI-WAN: What's going on?

ANAKIN: She covered the cameras. I don't think she liked me watching her.

OBI-WAN: What is she thinking?

ANAKIN: She programmed R2 to warn us if there's an intruder.

OBI-WAN: It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.

ANAKIN: I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master?

OBI-WAN: You're using her as bait??

ANAKIN: It was her idea... Don't worry, no harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.

OBI-WAN: It's too risky... besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.

ANAKIN: And yours are?

OBI-WAN: Possibly.


OBI-WAN: You look tired.

ANAKIN: I don't sleep well anymore.

OBI-WAN: Because of your mother?

ANAKIN: I don't know why I keep dreaming about her now.

OBI-WAN: Dreams pass in time.

ANAKIN: I'd much rather dream about Padmé. Just being around her again is... intoxicating.

OBI-WAN: Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin. They betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi Order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.

ANAKIN: She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.

OBI-WAN: It is my experience that Senators focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy in order to get those funds.

ANAKIN: Not another lecture, Master. At least not on the economics of politics...


ANAKIN: ...and besides, you're generalizing. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.

OBI-WAN: Palpatine's a politician.

OBI-WAN: I've observed that he is very clever in following the passions and the prejudices of the Senators.

ANAKIN: I think he is a good man. My...

OBI-WAN: I sense it, too.


ANAKIN: Stay here!

DORMÉ: Are you all right, M'Lady?


- What the?

- Jedi poo doo!

OBI-WAN: What took you so long?

ANAKIN: Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder  that I really liked ...

OBI-WAN: There he is.

ANAKIN: ...with an open cockpit... and the right speed capabilities.

OBI-WAN: If you spent as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

ANAKIN: I thought I already did.

OBI-WAN: Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.

OBI-WAN: pull up, Anakin. Pull up!


OBI-WAN: You know I don't like it when you do that!

ANAKIN: Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like flying.

OBI-WAN: I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide!

OBI-WAN: Anakin! How many times have I told you to stay away from the power couplings!
That was good!


OBI-WAN: Where are you going?!... He went that way.

ANAKIN: Master, if we keep this chase going any longer, that creep's gonna end up deep-fried and, personally, I'd very much like to find out who he is and who he's working for... This is a shortcut... I think.

OBI-WAN: Well, you've lost him.

ANAKIN: I'm deeply sorry, Master.

OBI-WAN: That was some short cut, Anakin. He went completely the other way! Once again you've proved ...

ANAKIN: If you'll execuse me.

OBI-WAN: I hate it when he does that.


OBI-WAN: Anakin!

ANAKIN: She went into that club, Master.

OBI-WAN: Patience. Use the Force. Think.

ANAKIN: Sorry, Master.

OBI-WAN: He went in there to hide, not run.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

OBI-WAN: Next time try not to lose it.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

OBI-WAN: This weapon is your life.

ANAKIN: I try, Master.

OBI-WAN: Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the
death of me?!

ANAKIN: Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I
have to a father.

OBI-WAN: Then why don't you listen to me?!

ANAKIN: I am trying.

OBI-WAN: Can you see him?

ANAKIN: I think he's a she... and I think she's a
changeling.

OBI-WAN: In that case be extra careful... Go and find her.

ANAKIN: Where are you going, Master?

OBI-WAN: For a drink.


OBI-WAN: Thank you.

ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO: You wanna buy some death-sticks?

OBI-WAN: You don't want to sell me death-sticks.

ELAN: I don't want to sell you death-sticks.

OBI-WAN: You want to go home and rethink your life.

ELAN: I want to go home and rethink my life.


ANAKIN: Easy... Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

OBI-WAN: Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?

ZAM WESSEL: It was a Senator from Naboo.

OBI-WAN: And who hired you?

ZAM WESSEL: It was just a job.

ANAKIN: Who hired you? Tell us! ... Tell us now!

ZAM: It was a Bounty Hunter called...

OBI-WAN: Toxic dart...

YODA: Track down this bounty hunter, you must, Obi-Wan.

MACE WINDU: Most importantly, find out who he's working for.

OBI-WAN: What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.

YODA: Handle that, your Padawan will.

MACE WINDU: Anakin, escort the Senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport. Travel as refugees.

ANAKIN: As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the Capital.

YODA: Until caught this killer is, our judgement she must respect.

MACE WINDU: Anakin, go to the Senate and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.

PALPATINE: I will talk to her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that.

ANAKIN: Thank you, your Excellency.

PALPATINE: And so, they've finally given you an assignment. Your patience has paid off.

ANAKIN: Your guidance more that my patience.

PALPATINE: You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

ANAKIN: Thank you, your Excellency.

PALPATINE: I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin. Even more powerful than Master Yoda.


OBI-WAN: I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.

YODA: The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.

MACE WINDU: The boy has exceptional skills.

OBI-WAN: But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him... well, arrogant.

YODA: Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.

MACE WINDU: Remember, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.


PADMÉ: I'm taking an extended leave of absence. It will be your responsibility to take my place in the Senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.

JAR JAR: Mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden. Mesa accept this with muy muy humility and da...

PADMÉ: Jar Jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

JAR JAR: Of course, M'Lady.

PADMÉ: I do not like this idea of hiding.

ANAKIN: Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.

PADMÉ: I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act to not be here when its fate is decided!

ANAKIN: Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.

PADMÉ: Anakin, you've grown up.

ANAKIN: Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.
Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor, as wise as Master Yoda and... as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. In some ways... a lot of ways... I'm really ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials... but he feels that I'm too unpredictable. He won't let me move on.

PADMÉ: That must be frustrating.

ANAKIN: It's worse. He's overly critical! He never listens! He doesn't understand. It's not fair!

PADMÉ: All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.

ANAKIN: I know

PADMÉ: Anakin... Don't try to grow up too fast.

ANAKIN: But I am grown up. You said it yourself.

PADMÉ: Please don't look at me like that.

ANAKIN: Why not?

PADMÉ: It makes me feel uncomfortable.

ANAKIN: Sorry, M'Lady.


CAPTAIN TYPHO: Be safe, M'Lady.

PADMÉ: Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dormé. The threat's on you two now.

DORMÉ: He'll be safe with me.

PADMÉ: You'll be fine.

DORMÉ: It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realize you've left the Capital?

PADMÉ: Well, then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is.

OBI-WAN: Anakin. Don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the Council.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

OBI-WAN: I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.

PADMÉ: I'll be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.

ANAKIN: Time to go.

PADMÉ: I know.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, may the Force be with you.

ANAKIN: May the Force be with you, Master.

PADMÉ: Suddenly I'm afraid...

ANAKIN: This is my first assignment on my own. I am too. Don't worry. We've got R2 with us.

OBI-WAN: I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: I'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him.


WIITRESS DROID: Someone to see ya, honey! A Jedi, by the looks of him.

DEXTER JETTSTER: Obi-Wan!

OBI-WAN: Hello, Dex.

DEXTER JETTSTER: Take a seat! I'll be right with ya!

WAITRESS DROID: You want a cup o'jawa juice?

OBI-WAN: Oh, yes. Thank you.

DEXTER JETTSTER: Hey, old buddy! So, my friend. What can I do for ya?

OBI-WAN: You can tell me what this is.

DEXTER JETTSTER: Well, whattaya know... I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting' on Subterrel, beyond the Outer Rim!

OBI-WAN: Can you tell me where it came from? Thank you.

DEXTER JETTSTER: This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

OBI-WAN: I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archive.

DEXTER JETTSTER: It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away. Those analysis droids only focus on symbols. I should think that you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and... wisdom.

OBI-WAN: Well, if droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there? Kamino. I'm not familiar with it. Is it in the Republic?

DEXTER JETTSTER: No, no. It's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about 12 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze. Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives. These Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN: Cloners? Are they friendly?

DEXTER JETTSTER: It depends.

OBI-WAN: Depends on what, Dex?

DEXTER JETTSTER: On how good your manners are... and how big your... pocketbook is.


JOCASTA NU: Did you call for assistance?

OBI-WAN: Yes... yes, I did...

JOCASTA NU: Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

OBI-WAN: Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino. It doesn't show up on the archives charts.

JOCASTA NU: Kamino. It's not a system I/m familiar with. Are you sure you have the right coordinates?

OBI-WAN: According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here... just south of the Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU: I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exists.

OBI-WAN: Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

JOCASTA NU: If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exists.


SERVER: Hey, you! No Droids! Get outta here!

PADMÉ: Thank you, R2.
Must be difficult, having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.

ANAKIN: Or be with the people that I love.

PADMÉ: Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

ANAKIN: Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life. So you might say we are encouraged to love.

PADMÉ: You have changed so much.

ANAKIN: You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.


YODA: Reach out. Sense the Force around you. Use your feelings you must. Younglings, Younglings! A visitor we have.

CHILDREN: Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Hello. I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

YODA: What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

OBI-WAN: I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.

YODA: Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing... how embarrassing. Liam, the shades. Gather round the map reader. Clear your minds... and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

OBI-WAN: It ought to be here... but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area towards this spot

YODA: Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all the planets disappeared they have. How can this be? A thought? Anyone.

JEDI CHILD JACK: Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory.

YODA: Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. The Padawan is right. Go to the center of the gravity's pull, and find your planet you will. The data must have been erased.

OBI-WAN: But Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives? That's impossible. Isn't it?

YODA: Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. Meditate on this, I will.


PADMÉ: I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected. But now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.

ANAKIN: The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office.

PADMÉ: I was relieved when my two terms were up. But when the queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

ANAKIN: I agree with her. I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve.

PADMÉ: If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.

SIO BIBBLE: It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full scale war since the formation of the Republic!

QUEEN JAMILLIA: Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?

PADMÉ: Not if they feel threatened. My guess is they'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help

SIO BIBBLE: It's outrageous, but after four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the Senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.

QUEEN JAMILLIA: We must keep our faith in the Republic.
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.

PADMÉ: Let's pray that day never comes.

QUEEN JAMILLIA: In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE: What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

PADMÉ: Anakin's not a Jedi yet. He's still a Padawan learner. But I was thinking...

ANAKIN: Hold on a minute!

PADMÉ: Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.

ANAKIN: Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.

PADMÉ: And this is my home. I know it very well. That is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you to took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.

ANAKIN: Sorry, M'Lady.

QUEEN JAMILLIA: Perfect. It's settled then.


OBI-WAN: There it is, R4, right where it should be. Our missing planet, Kamino.

TAUN WE: Master Jedi. The Prime Minister expects you.

OBI-WAN: I'm expected?

TAUN WE: Of course! He is anxious to meet you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way!
May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi...

OBI-WAN: Obi-Wan Kenobi.

LAMA SU: I trust you are going to enjoy your stay, please. And now to business. You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million more well on the way.

OBI-WAN: That's... good news.

LAMA SU: Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas that his order will be met on time.

OBI-WAN: I'm sorry. Master - ?

LAMA SU: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?

OBI-WAN: Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.

LAMA SU: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him.

OBI-WAN: The army?

LAMA SU: Yes, a clone army. And, I must say, one of the finest we've ever created.

OBI-WAN: Tell me, Prime Minister, when my Master first contacted you about the army, did he say who it was for?

LAMA SU: Of course he did. This army is for the Republic. But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.

OBI-WAN: That's why I'm here.


PADMÉ: We used to come here for school retreat. We would swim to that island on every day. I love the water. We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.

ANAKIN: I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything's soft... and smooth.

PADMÉ: No. I shouldn't have done that.

ANAKIN: I'm sorry.


OBI-WAN: Very impressive.

LAMA SU: I hoped you would be pleased. Clones can think creatively. You will find that they are immensely superior to droids. We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago.

OBI-WAN: You mentioned growth acceleration...

LAMA SU: Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time.

OBI-WAN: I see.

LAMA SU: They are totally obedient taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host.

OBI-WAN: And who was the original host?

LAMA SU: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

OBI-WAN: And where is this bounty hunter now?

LAMA SU: Oh, we keep him here.

LAMA SU: Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: Unaltered?

LAMA SU: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration.

OBI-WAN: I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.

TAUN WE: I would be very happy to arrange it for you.

LAMA SU: Magnificent, aren't they?


PADMÉ: I don't know...

ANAKIN: Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me.

PADMÉ: You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?

ANAKIN: They only work on the weak-minded.

PADMÉ: All right... I was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Programme. He was a few years older then I. Very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.

ANAKIN: All right, I get the picture. Whatever happened to him?

PADMÉ: I went into public service. He went on to become an artist.

ANAKIN: Maybe he was the smart one.

PADMÉ: You really don't like politicians, do you?

ANAKIN: I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.

PADMÉ: How would you have it work?

ANAKIN: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.

PADMÉ: That's exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree.

ANAKIN: Well, then they should be made to.

PADMÉ: By whom? Who's going to make them?

ANAKIN: I don't know. Someone.

PADMÉ: You?

ANAKIN: Of course not me.

PADMÉ: But someone.

ANAKIN: Someone wise.

PADMÉ: That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

ANAKIN: Well, if it works...

PADMÉ: You're making fun of me!

ANAKIN: No, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.


PADMÉ: Ani, Ani! Are you all right?


TAUN WE: Boba, is your father here?

BOBA FETT: Yep.

TAUN WE: May we see him?

BOBA FETT: Sure. Dad! Taun We's here!

TAUN WE: Jango, welcome back. Was your trip productive?

JANGO FETT: Fairly.

TAUN WE: This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress.

OBI-WAN: Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.

JANGO FETT: I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe.

OBI-WAN: Ever make your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?

JANGO FETT: Once or twice.

OBI-WAN: Recently?

JANGO FETT: Possibly...

OBI-WAN: Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas?

JANGO FETT: Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

JANGO FETT: Master who?

OBI-WAN: Sifo-Dyas. Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job?

JANGO FETT: Never heard of him.

OBI-WAN: Really?

JANGO FETT: I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.

OBI-WAN: Curious.

JANGO FETT: Do you like your army?

OBI-WAN: I look forward to seeing them in action.

JANGO FETT: They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that.

OBI-WAN: Thank you for your time, Jango.

JANGO FETT: Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

BOBA FETT: What is it, Dad?

JANGO FETT: Pack your things. We're leaving.


ANAKIN: And when I got to them, we went into... aggressive  negotiations.
Thank you.

PADMÉ: "Aggressive negotiations," what's that?

ANAKIN: Uh, well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

PADMÉ: Oh.

ANAKIN: If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

ANAKIN: From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you... I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...
If you are suffering as much as I am, please tell me.

PADMÉ: I can't. We can't. It's... just not possible.

ANAKIN: Anything is possible. Padmé. Listen to me.

PADMÉ: No, you listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.

ANAKIN: Then you do feel something!

PADMÉ: I will not let you give up your future for me.

ANAKIN: You're asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings away... but I can't.

PADMÉ: I will not give in to this.

ANAKIN: Well, you know... it wouldn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret.

PADMÉ: We'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?

ANAKIN: No. You're right. It would destroy us.


LAMA SU: Tell your Council that  the first battalions are ready. And remind them, if they need more troops, it will take more time to grow them.

OBI-WAN: I won't forget. And thank you.

TAUN WE: Thank you.


OBI-WAN: R4!

OBI-WAN: "Scramble code five," to Courscant, care of "the old folks' home!"
I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army. I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.

MACE WINDU: Do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

OBI-WAN: No, Master. There appears to be no motive.

YODA: Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear, your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind the plot.

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. They say a Master Sifo-Dyas placed the order for a clone army at the request of the Senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression he was killed before that. Did the Council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?

MACE WINDU: No. Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council.

YODA: Bring him here. Question him, we will.

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.

YODA: Blind we are, if creation of this clone army we could not see.

MACE WINDU: I think it is time we informed the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.

YODA: Only the Dark Lords of the Sith know of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply our adversaries will.


ANAKIN: No... No... Mom, no!... Don't!


ANAKIN: Don't go.

PAMDÉ: I don't want to disturb you.

ANAKIN: Your presence is soothing.

PADMÉ: You had another nightmare last night.

ANAKIN: Jedi don't have nightmares.

PADMÉ: I heard you.

ANAKIN: I saw my mother. She is suffering, Padmé. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She is in pain... I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. But I have to go. I have to help her!

PADMÉ: I'll go with you.

ANAKIN: I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.


BOBA FETT: Dad!! Look!

JANGO FETT: Boba, get on board.

OBI-WAN: Oh, not good.


ANAKIN: Wait right that.

DROID: Okey-okey.

WATTO: No wanga.

ANAKIN: Chut, chut, Watto. Ding mi chasa hopa.

WATTO: Ke Booda? Yo baan pee hota. Jedi. Du Jedi. No bata tu tu.

ANAKIN: Mi boska di Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO: Ani?? Little Ani?? Nahhh!!
You are Ani! It is you! You sure sprouted, huh! A Jedi! Whattaya know? Hey, maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

ANAKIN: My mother.

WATTO: Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

ANAKIN: You sold her?

WATTO: Years ago. Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business. I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. At least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that, eh?

ANAKIN: Do you know where they are now?

WATTO: Long way from here. Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think.

ANAKIN: I'd like to know.

WATTO: Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records, huh?


BOBA FETT: Dad! I think we're being tracked.

JANGO FETT: He must have put a homing device on our hull. Hang on, son. We'll move into the asteroid field... and we'll have a couple of surprises for him.

OBI-WAN: Seismic charges. Stand by.

JANGO FETT: He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

BOBA FETT: Watch out!

BOBA FETT: Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!

OBI-WAN: Blast! This is why I hate flying!

BOBA FETT: We got him!

JANGO FETT: We'll just have to finish him.

OBI-WAN: R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters. Fire them now!

JANGO FETT: We won't be seeing him again.

OBI-WAN: Well, R4. I think we've waited long enough.
There's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, R4.


PADMÉ: Stay with the ship, R2.

C-3PO: Oh, hello. How might I be of service? I am C-...

ANAKIN: 3PO?

C-3PO: Oh... Oh, my maker! Master Ani! I knew you would return, I knew it! And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

PADMÉ: Hello, 3PO.

C-3PO: Bless my circuits! I'm so pleased to see you both!

ANAKIN: I've come to see my mother.

C-3PO: I think... perhaps we'd better go indoors.
Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors?

ANAKIN: I'm Anakin Skywalker.

OWEN: Owen Lars. This is my girlfriend, Beru.

BERU: Hello.

PADMÉ: I'm Padmé.

OWEN: I guess I'm your stepbrother. I had a feeling you might show up some day.

ANAKIN: Is my mother here?

CLIEGG: No, she's not.
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... We should go inside. We have a lot to talk about.
It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.
Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators. From the tracks, she was about halfway home when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg, I just couldn't ride any more until I heal. I don't want to give up on her but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.

OWEN: Where are you going?

ANAKIN: To find my mother.

CLIEGG: Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

ANAKIN: You're gonna have to stay here. These are good people, Padmé. You'll be safe.

PADMÉ: Anakin...

ANAKIN: I won't be long.


COUNT DOOKU: We must persuade the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.

NUTE GUNRAY: What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I'm not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.

COUNT DOOKU: I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

POGGLE: With these new Battle Droids we've built for you, you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

COUNT DOOKU: As I explained to you earlier, I'm quite convinced that ten thousand more systems will rally to our cause with your support, gentlemen.

SHU MAI: What you are proposing could be constructed as treason.

WAT TAMBOR: The Techno Union army... is at your disposal, Count.

SAN HILL: The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

COUNT DOOKU: Good. Very good. Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support. and when their battle droids are combined with yours we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy. The Jedi will be overwhelmed. The Republic will agree to any demands we make.


ANAKIN: Mom... Mom... Mom?

SHMI: Ani...? Ani? Is it you...?

ANAKIN: I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

SHMI: Ani? Ani? You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. I'm so proud of you, Ani. I missed you. Now I am complete. I love y...

ANAKIN: Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

SHMI: I love... I love...


QUI-GON: Anakin! Anakin! No!

MACE WINDU: What is it?

YODA: Pain, suffering, death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain, terrible pain.


OBI-WAN: The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal. Coruscant's too far. R4, can you boost the power?
We'll have to try something else. Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo. It's much closer. Anakin, Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin. He's not on Naboo, R4. I'm going to try and widen the range. I do hope nothing's happened to him.
That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right, but it's coming from Tatooine. What in the blazes is he doing there? I told him to stay on Naboo.
We haven't much time. Anakin? Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Record this message and take it to your mistress, Padmé... and the Jedi Skywalker... "Anakin, my long range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant."


PADMÉ: I brought you something. Are you hungry?

ANAKIN: The shifter broke. Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things. I'm good at fixing things... always was. But I couldn't... Why'd she have to die? Why couldn't I save her? I know I could have!

PADMÉ: Sometimes there are things no one can fix. You're not all-powerful, Ani.

ANAKIN: Well, I should be! Someday I will be. I will be the most powerful Jedi ever! I promise you, I will even learn to stop people from dying.

PADMÉ: Anakin...

ANAKIN: It's all Obi-Wan's fault. He's jealous! He's holding me back!

PADMÉ: What's wrong, Ani?

ANAKIN: I... I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals... I hate them!

PADMÉ: To be angry is to be human.

ANAKIN: I'm a Jedi. I know I'm better than this.


CLIEGG: I know wherever you are it's become a better place. You were the most loving partner a man could ever have. Goodbye, my darling wife. And thank you.

ANAKIN: I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom. I wasn't strong enough. But I promise I won't fail again... I miss you... so much.

PADMÉ: R2, what are you doing here?

R2: Beeps and whistles.

C-3PO: It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi- Wan Kenobi. Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you?


OBI-WAN: Anakin, my long range transmitter has been knocked out. Retransmit this message to Coruscant.
I have tracked the bounty hunter Jango Fett to the droid foundries on Geonosis. The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here and it is clear that Viceroy
Gunray is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala. The Commerce Guilds and Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... Wait!!

YODA: More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.

MACE WINDU: I agree.
Anakin, We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your first priority.

ANAKIN: Understood, Master.

PADMÉ: They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

ANAKIN: If he's still alive.

PADMÉ: Ani, are you just gonna sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...

ANAKIN: He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.

PADMÉ: He gave you strict orders to protect me...
...and I'm going to help Obi-Wan. If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.

C-3PO: I'm not worried R2. It's just I've never flown before.


BAIL ORGANA: The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that.

PALPATINE: Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.

ASK AAK: The debate is over! Now we need that clone army.

BAIL ORGANA: Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never approve the use of the clones before the separatists attack.

MAS AMEDDA: This is a crisis! The Senate must vote the Chancellor emergency powers! He can then approve the creation of an army.

PALPATINE: But what Senator would have the courage to propose such a radical amendment?

MAS AMEDDA: If only Senator Amidala were here.


OBI-WAN: Traitor!

COUNT DOOKU: Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake. They've gone too far. This is madness.

OBI-WAN: I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

COUNT DOOKU: This had nothing to do with me, I assure you. I will petition immediately to have you set free.

OBI-WAN: Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do.

COUNT DOOKU: May I ask why a Jedi Knight is all the way out here on Geonosis?

OBI-WAN: I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Do you know him?

COUNT DOOKU: There are no bounty hunters here that I'm aware of. Geonosians don't trust them.

OBI-WAN: Well, who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you.

COUNT DOOKU: It's a great pity that our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you. I wish he were still alive. I could use his help right now.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

COUNT DOOKU: Don't be so sure, my young Jedi. You forget that he was once my apprentice just as you were once his. He knew all about the corruption in the Senate, but he wouldn't have gone along with it if he had known the truth as I have.

OBI-WAN: The truth?

COUNT DOOKU: The truth. What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control of the Dark Lords of the Sith?

OBI-WAN: No, that's not possible. The Jedi would be aware of it.

COUNT DOOKU: The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend. Hundreds of Senators are now under the influence of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious.

OBI-WAN: I don't believe you.

COUNT DOOKU: The Viceroy of the Trade Federation was once in league with this Darth Sidious. But he was betrayed ten years ago by the Dark Lord. He came to me for help. He told me everything. You must join me, Obi-Wan, and together we will destroy the Sith.

OBI-WAN: I will never join you, Dooku.

COUNT DOOKU: It may be difficult to secure your release.


JAR JAR: It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact... wesa desa Federation du Trade. Senators, "dellow felagates". In response to this direct threat to the Republic mesa propose that the Senate give immediately emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.

Palpatine! Palpatine!

MAS AMEDDA: Order! We shall have order!

PALPATINE: It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated. And as my first act with this new authority, I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.

MACE WINDU: It is done then. I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

YODA: Visit I will the cloners on Kamino and see this army they have created for the Republic.


PADMÉ: See those columns of a steam straight ahead? They're exhaust vents of some type.

ANAKIN: That'll do.

PADMÉ: Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead. I'm not interested in getting into a war here. As a member of the Senate, maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.

ANAKIN: Don't worry. I've given up trying to argue with you.

C-3PO: My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help, they would have asked for it. You obviously have a great deal to learn about humans behaviour. For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking. I am programmed to understand humans!

R2: beeps a question.

C-3PO: What does that mean? That means I am in charge here! Hey, where are you going now? You don't know what's out there. Have you no sense at all? Idiot! Please wait. Do you know where you're going?

R2: bleeps at 3PO.

ANAKIN: Wait.
Padmé!

C-3PO: Oh my goodness! Shut me down! Machines making machines. How perverse. Calm down, R2. I almost fell. You'll get your chance...
I'm scrap. It's a nightmare. I want to go home! What did I do to deserve this!
I wonder what happened to poor little R2. He's always getting himself into trouble. Oh, no!

Droid: Uh-oh.

C-3PO: I'm so confused.

ANAKIN: Not again. Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

JANGO FETT: Don't move, Jedi! Take him away.


ANAKIN: Don't be afraid.

PADMÉ: I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.

ANAKIN: What are you talking about?

PADMÉ: I love you.

ANAKIN: You love me? I thought we had decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie and that it would destroy our lives...

PADMÉ: I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.

OBI-WAN: I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.

ANAKIN: I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.

OBI-WAN: Good job!

POGGLE: Settle down. Settle down.
Let the executions begin!

ANAKIN: I've got a bad feeling about this.

OBI-WAN: Just relax. Concentrate.

ANAKIN: What about Padmé?

OBI-WAN: She seems to be on top of things.

NUTE GUNRAY: She can't do that... shoot her or something!

ANAKIN: Jump

NUTE GUNRAY: This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off!

COUNT DOOKU: Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.
Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us.

MACE WINDU: This party's over.

COUNT DOOKU: Brave, but foolish, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered.

MACE WINDU: I don't think so.

COUNT DOOKU: We'll see.

Droid: My legs aren't moving. I must need maintenance.

C-3PO: What's all this noise? A battle! There's been some terrible mistake! I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!
Die, Jedi dogs! Oh. What did I say?
Oh, dear. I'm terribly sorry about all this.
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

ANAKIN: You call this a diplomatic solution?

PADMÉ: No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

Droid: Uh-oh.
Droid: Roger, roger.

C-3PO: R2, what are you doing here? What are you doing? Stop that! You're going to strain something. My neck! Now where are you taking me? This is such a drag! I'm quite beside myself. R2, please be careful! You're singeing my circuits! Yes, but is my head on straight?

COUNT DOOKU: Master Windu! You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in archives of the Jedi order. Now it is finished. Surrender - and your lives will be spared.

MACE WINDU: We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!

COUNT DOOKU: Then, I'm sorry, old friend.

PADMÉ: Look!

YODA: Around the survivors a perimeter create.

C-3PO: I had the most peculiar dream!

YODA: If Dooku escapes rally more systems to this cause he will.

OBI-WAN: Hold on!

ANAKIN: Aim right above the fuel cells!

OBI-WAN: Good call, my young Padawan.

NUTE GUNRAY: The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

COUNT DOOKU: That doesn't seem possible. How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly?

NUTE GUNRAY: We must send all available droids into battle.

COUNT DOOKU: There are too many.

POGGLE: Our communications have been jammed.

MACE WINDU: Pilot, land in that assembly area!

Clone pilot: Yes, sir.

Clone: Sir, I have five special commando units awaiting your orders, sir.

YODA: To the forward command centre take me.

OBI-WAN: Attack those Federation starships, quickly!

CLONE COMMANDER: Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing.

YODA: Very good. Very good.

NUTE GUNRAY: This is not looking good at all.

RUNE HAAKO: We must get the starships back into space.

POGGLE: We have to order a retreat.

COUNT DOOKU: My Master will never allow the Republic to get away with this treachery.

POGGLE: I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs. The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon. If they find out what we are planning to build, we are doomed.

COUNT DOOKU: I will take the designs with me to Coruscant. They will be much safer there with my Master.

YODA: Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.

CLONE COMMANDER: Yes, sir.
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

OBI-WAN: Look over there...

ANAKIN: It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

CLONE CAPTAIN: We're out of rockets, sir.

ANAKIN: Follow him!

PADMÉ: We're gonna need some help.

OBI-WAN: There isn't time. Anakin and I can handle this.

ANAKIN: Padmé!!
Put the ship down!

OBI-WAN: Anakin, don't let your personal feelings get in the way.
Follow that speeder.

ANAKIN: Lower the ship!

OBI-WAN: I can't take Dooku alone. I need you. If we catch him, we can end this war right now. We have a job to do!

ANAKIN: I don't care. Put the ship down.

OBI-WAN: You'll be expelled from the Jedi Order!

ANAKIN: I can't leave her!

OBI-WAN: Come to your senses. What do you think Padmé would do if she were in your position?

ANAKIN: She would do her duty.

YODA: Hmmmm...

CLONE COMMANDER: The droid army is in full retreat.

YODA: Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.

ANAKIN: You're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.

OBI-WAN: We'll take him together - you go in slowly on the left...

ANAKIN: No, I'm taking him now!

OBI-WAN: No! Anakin, no!

COUNT DOOKU: As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now... back down.

OBI-WAN: I don't think so.

COUNT DOOKU: Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
Surely you can do better.

CLONE TROOPER: Are you all right?

PADMÉ: Uh-huh.

CLONE TROOPER: We'd better get back to the forward Command Center.

PADMÉ: No, no. Gather what troops you can. We've got to get to that hanger. Get a transport. Hurry!

CLONE TROOPER: Right away.

COUNT DOOKU: Brave of you, boy. But I would have thought you'd have learned your lesson.

ANAKIN: I am a slow learner.

COUNT DOOKU: Master Yoda.

YODA: Count Dooku.

COUNT DOOKU: You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.

YODA: Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.

COUNT DOOKU: I've become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.

YODA: Much to learn you still have.

COUNT DOOKU: It is obvious that this contest can not be decided by our knowledge of the Force, but by our skills with a lightsaber.

YODA: Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

COUNT DOOKU: This is just the beginning.


PADMÉ: Anakin!


COUNT DOOKU: The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.

COUNT DOOKU: I have good news for you, my Lord. The war has begun.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Excellent. Everything is going as planned.


OBI-WAN: Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the Senate? It doesn't feel right.

YODA: Joined the dark side Dooku has. Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are his ways now.

MACE WINDU: Nevertheless, I feel we should keep a closer eye on the Senate.

YODA: I agree.

MACE WINDU: Where is your apprentice?

OBI-WAN: On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home. I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.

YODA: Victory? Victory, you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun the Clone War has.
